# PalindromicNumbers

Determine the smallest base in which the first n positive decimal integers are palindromes. Run from the command line by passing in n, the number of positive decimal integers to find the smallest base for.

```
  ./palindromic_numbers 1000
```

The results with the smallest base for each number are saved to the "smallest_bases.csv" file.
